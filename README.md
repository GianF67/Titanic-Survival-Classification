# Titanic Survival Classification Analysis
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Analysis repository! This project utilizes the dataset from the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition hosted by Kaggle. The goal is to develop a predictive model that determines which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.
This project is implemented using PySpark and is designed to be run on Google Colab, offering a robust environment for large-scale data processing and model development.

## Features
The repository contains:
- Data Cleaning: Scripts and notebooks dedicated to preparing the Titanic dataset for analysis.
- EDA: Notebooks that explore the dataset through visualizations and statistics to identify patterns and insights.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Evaluation of different classification algorithms to find the most effective predictor for survival.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques and processes used to optimize the parameters for the best model performance.
- Model Comparison: Comparative analysis of the models to select the most accurate one for predicting survival.
- Survival Prediction: Final model application to predict the survival outcomes of the Titanic passengers.
